//  The `main` file serves as the entry point for a Swift command-line application.
//  In Swift, the program execution starts from the top of the `main.swift` file,
//  where the code is executed sequentially. There is no explicit `main()` function
//  like in some other programming languages; instead, the contents of this file
//  are treated as the main body of the program.
